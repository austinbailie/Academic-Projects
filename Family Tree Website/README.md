Project: Family Tree Website

Description:

A website which can have GEDCOM family tree files uploaded to it. Once uploaded, the program passes the file to a C program using a foreign function interface using JavaScript. The C program parses the GEDCOM file, and returns JSON strings based on the action performed by the user on the website. The user can search for specific individuals and receive either a list of ancestors or descendants of that individual. Also includes information on each individual, including birth place and date, gender, their spouse and children, parents, and date of death. All information on the individuals can be viewed in a scrollable table. In addition, with the correct credentials, you can sign into a SQL database containing all previously uploaded files and individuals.
